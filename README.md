Hey people,

I am happy to introduce you to my new project. After my first construction site on the Senora Freeway, there is now a bridge construction site in Los Santos! The bridge on Capital Boulevard.

A crane with cargo hanging from it is set up on each side of the bridge. While there are larger scaffoldings erected on both sides of the bridge. You can also see a low-loader with material as well as an open container with additional material and a first aid kit. There are several minor road defects on the bridge itself that are cordoned off and will need to be addressed in the future. 🛠️

As with my last construction sites, the NPCs drive around the construction site here, and I also removed the running NPCs on the bridge. Again, feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
